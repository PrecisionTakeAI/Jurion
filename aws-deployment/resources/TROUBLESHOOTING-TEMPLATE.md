## COMMON ERROR SOLUTIONS

### Error: "Container keeps restarting"

**Symptoms:**
- ECS shows task stopping and starting repeatedly
- Health checks failing
- Application never becomes available

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Memory Issues**
   ```
   Solution: Increase memory in task definition
   - Current: 512 MB
   - Try: 1024 MB or 2048 MB
   ```

2. **Missing Environment Variables**
   ```
   Check: ECS Task Definition â†’ Environment Variables
   Common missing ones:
   - DATABASE_URL
   - REDIS_URL
   - SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. **Database Connection Failed**
   ```
   Check:
   1. RDS instance is running
   2. Security group allows connection from ECS
   3. Database password is correct in Secrets Manager
   4. Database name exists
   ```

### Error: "Access Denied"

**Symptoms:**
- Can't upload to S3
- Can't read secrets
- Can't write logs

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **IAM Role Missing Permissions**
   ```
   Solution: Add required permissions to task role
   
   For S3:
   - s3:GetObject
   - s3:PutObject
   - s3:ListBucket
   
   For Secrets:
   - secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
   
   For Logs:
   - logs:CreateLogStream
   - logs:PutLogEvents
   ```

2. **Wrong Resource ARN**
   ```
   Check: The exact resource name/path
   Common mistake: Bucket name vs object path
   
   Wrong: arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket
   Right: arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*
   ```

### Error: "Health check failed"

**Symptoms:**
- Load balancer shows unhealthy targets
- Application works locally but not on AWS
- 502 Bad Gateway errors

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Wrong Health Check Path**
   ```
   Check: Load Balancer â†’ Target Groups â†’ Health Check
   Should be: /health or /api/health
   Not: / (unless your app responds there)
   ```

2. **Timeout Too Short**
   ```
   Increase health check settings:
   - Timeout: 30 seconds (was 5)
   - Interval: 60 seconds (was 30)
   - Healthy threshold: 2 (was 5)
   ```

3. **Application Slow to Start**
   ```
   Add startup grace period:
   - ECS Service â†’ Update â†’ Health check grace period: 300 seconds
   ```

### Error: "Database connection refused"

**Symptoms:**
- Can't connect to RDS
- "Connection refused" or "timeout" errors
- Works from local but not from AWS

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Security Group Issue**
   ```
   Fix: RDS security group must allow:
   - Port: 5432 (PostgreSQL)
   - Source: ECS security group (not IP address)
   ```

2. **Wrong Endpoint**
   ```
   Check: RDS instance â†’ Connectivity â†’ Endpoint
   Format: instance-name.xxxxx.ap-southeast-2.rds.amazonaws.com
   NOT the read replica endpoint
   ```

3. **VPC/Subnet Issue**
   ```
   Ensure:
   - RDS and ECS in same VPC
   - ECS tasks in private subnet with NAT gateway
   - Route tables properly configured
   ```

### Error: "Out of memory"

**Symptoms:**
- Application crashes after running for a while
- "Cannot allocate memory" errors
- Slow performance before crash

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Memory Leak in Application**
   ```
   Quick fix: Restart containers daily
   - Set up CloudWatch event
   - Restart ECS service at 3 AM
   
   Proper fix: Find and fix memory leak
   ```

2. **Insufficient Memory Allocated**
   ```
   Increase in task definition:
   - Current: 2048 MB
   - Recommended: 4096 MB for production
   ```

3. **Large File Processing**
   ```
   Implement streaming:
   - Don't load entire file into memory
   - Process in chunks
   - Use S3 multipart upload
   ```
